This document summarizes the key business insights derived from the churn and revenue analysis and provides actionable recommendations for reducing customer churn and revenue loss.

## Insight 1: Month-to-month contracts are the primary driver of churn and revenue loss

**Evidence**
- Month-to-month customers exhibit significantly higher churn rates compared to long-term contracts.
- The majority of monthly revenue at risk is concentrated within month-to-month contracts.
- Dashboard reference:

  - Page 3: Revenue Leakage

**Recommendation**
- Introduce targeted incentives (discounts, loyalty benefits) to migrate month-to-month customers to annual contracts.
- Prioritize customers with tenure greater than 6 months, as they show higher conversion potential.

## Insight 2: Early-tenure customers churn at the highest rate

**Evidence**
- Customers within the first 0–6 months show the highest churn percentage.
- This pattern indicates potential issues in onboarding or early customer experience.
- Dashboard reference:
  - Page 2: Churn Drivers (Tenure Analysis)

**Recommendation**
- Strengthen onboarding programs during the first 90 days.
- Implement early engagement initiatives such as usage education and proactive support.

## Insight 3: Medium and high CLTV customers contribute disproportionately to revenue loss

**Evidence**
- While high CLTV customers represent a smaller portion of the customer base, they account for a large share of revenue at risk.
- Revenue loss is more strongly correlated with customer value than churn volume.
- Dashboard reference:
  - Page 3: Revenue Leakage (CLTV Analysis)

**Recommendation**
- Develop retention strategies focused on medium and high CLTV customers.
- Use predictive churn scoring to proactively engage high-value customers before contract termination.

## Insight 4: Revenue loss is concentrated in a small number of regions

**Evidence**
- A limited set of regions contributes a disproportionately high share of total revenue at risk.
- In several regions, revenue loss is driven more by customer volume than churn rate.
- Dashboard reference:
  - Page 4: Regional Revenue Impact

**Recommendation**
- Implement region-specific retention strategies instead of uniform national campaigns.
- Allocate retention budgets based on revenue impact rather than churn percentage alone.

## Insight 5: Payment method friction correlates with higher churn

**Evidence**
- Customers using manual or electronic check payment methods show higher churn rates than automated payment options.
- This suggests operational friction may contribute to customer dissatisfaction.
- Dashboard reference:
  - Page 2: Churn Drivers (Payment Method)

**Recommendation**
- Encourage customers to adopt automated payment methods through incentives.
- Simplify billing communication to reduce payment-related friction.
